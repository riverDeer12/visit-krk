    "description": "Welcome to the historic center of Omišalj, a picturesque and layered urban structure with elements of medieval architecture, Renaissance, Baroque, historical styles of the 19th and the early 20th century. Omišalj was founded on the basis of an earlier village whose roots go back to prehistory. The original fort-type habitat defended by strong dry-walled ramparts was the seat of the Liburnian tribal community of Fertinata. It stagnated during the Roman Empire, when the nearby coastal country and port city of Fulfinum was developing, and flourished again during the early and developed Middle Ages.<br><br>Omišalj was the first among the already existing villages on the island, which in the early Middle Ages were populated en masse by immigrant Croats, achieving a harmonious coexistence with the Romanized indigenous community. During the Middle Ages, it was a stronghold of the princes of Krk, later Frankapans, who built two strong fortifications in front of it and next to it. The Venetians who ruled Omišalj in 1480 justifiably called it the 'key to the island of Krk' due to its strategic importance. Even today, this is clear to anyone who enters the historic center of city and finds himself on one of its lookouts from which one could easily see a good part of the Kvarner Bay. As nowhere else on the island of Krk, in Omišalj, parts of medieval and renaissance architecture intertwine with unusual out-of-style architectural structures. We are great as much as we hold on to the values we inherit, and as much as we preserve them for future generations. If we connect historical, artistic, archeological and historiographical data with the specifics of Omišalj tradition, speech, folk songs and customs, we will discover much about the turbulent history of this part of the island which has remained the key to the island of Krk."

      "description": "The remains of an interesting sacral edifice, the church of St Mary of the Spring is located in the camp Ježevac, on an elevated plateau,\n    surrounded by a forest. The church was first mentioned in 1486, but only the fact that it existed, not when it was built. The church is a simple,,\n    single-nave structure with semicircular apse protruding on the east side, the walls of which are made of dressed stones laid in regular layers.,\n    This way of masonry, the dimension and form of the edifice are characteristic for Romanesque churches, made from the 12th until the 13th century.,\n    Still, the findings of decorative stone reliefs indicate its slightly earlier emergence, in the 11th century. In the later stage of construction,,\n    a smaller rectangular addition was added on the northern side of the church. The thickness of the walls indicates that this was a high structure,,\n    probably a bell tower. The church is on a dominant position, offering a view of the channel, so the bell tower obviously served to alarm the,\n    population of the nearby city of Krk in case of incoming danger from the sea.,\n    A significant finding was discovered east of the church, near the apse. Here, in a live rock rising about fifty centimetres above the ground level,,\n    a deep pit was discovered, which may be interpreted as a natural well. There are visible traces of dressing on the rock, which made this inaccessible,\n    natural creation into a usable source of water through human activity. This well-spring is obviously the reason why the church was located at this,\n    site and it is the holder of the name Sancta Maria delle Aque, or St Mary of the Spring.,\n    The local tradition, noted around 1500, mentions a legend related to the church about the arrival of St Francis to the island of Krk, where he hid,\n    with his brothers from the incoming storm in the harbour along the church of the Mother of God. According to the legend, this is where they found a,\n    hermit who was taught about the rules of their order. The hermit accepted those rules and they became the basis of the establishment of the Franciscan,\n    order in the city of Krk.",

According to its stylistic characteristics it was dated into the 1st century and represents the work,\n    of several masters. The centre of the mosaic is dominated by the mythological being Triton, with a human body and a fish tail. Triton is the sea deity,,\n    the son of Poseidon and the Nereid Amphitrite. It is surrounded by images of sea fauna, dolphins and fish with stylized dragon-like features. It is,\n    assumed that Triton is just one of four figures of this mosaic floor. There is the image of the wine container – cantharus in the mosaic decoration.,\n    The container is held by another mythological being with a human torso, horse legs and a fish tail, probably an Ichthyocentaurus. Owing to the damage of,\n    the mosaic, only his mane and trident in the left hand can be recognized. The merry atmosphere and the content of the illustration indicate that this is a,\n    scene of a sea feast.,\n    The third mythological being is also preserved only in traces. This is probably Hermes’ son Pan. This is indicated by the illustration of the syrinx with,\n    which he contributed to the atmosphere of the feast.,\n    By establishing the existence of the three figures, Triton, Ichthyocentaurus and Pan, completely equal in their presentation, standing approximately at,\n    the same distance from each other, we get the impression that the fourth figure is missing, the one that would complete the image of the entire sea feast.,\n    This mosaic was probably the floor of the thermae in a luxurious private building.",

The castrum is dated into the time of late Antiquity as one of a series of,\n    structures of early Byzantine military architecture, emerged along the east Adriatic coast during the spread of castrization. This and similar castrums,\n    served as watchtowers and military bases, while their function resulted from the wish to make the waterways safe, but also to serve as refuge for the,\n    nearby villages. Within the fortress walls, on the north-east slightly elevated plateau, there are still the remains of the church dating from the 6th century.,\n    In the fertile coastal lowland Bosar there are still visible remains of three other churches.

This reconstruction,\n    demolished the church of St John the Evangelist, mentioned in the canonical visitation from 1565 as a separate edifice, detached from the parish church and used as a baptistery.,\n    Recent archaeological research conducted in the smaller garden discovered the remains of an older edifice along the church façade with a semicircular wall, perhaps an,\n    apse of an older sacral edifice which preceded the today’s church.,\n    The bell tower, the indispensable motif of the Vrbnik landscape, is located to the west of the church. It was built in 1527, which is witnessed by the Glagolitic,\n    inscription at its entrance. It had four bells – three large ones and one smaller one.",

Until today the Romanesque edifice has remained preserved with,\n    its extremely rich inventory, and small additional constructions from the later period of Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque stylistic features.,\n    The archaeological findings prove the existence of the original antique layer, the thermae from the 1st century, at the site of today’s cathedral.,\n    Considerable reconstruction was undertaken in the Romanesque period on the entire cathedral complex. The inscription on the cathedral,\n    mentions the reconstruction of the colonnade (columnarum opus) in the 12th century, conducted by the unknown Krk bishop (mentioned by the initial D),,\n    but it most probably happened during the time of the bishop Dabar (Dobro – Bonus) around 1179. A part of the cathedral complex today,\n    constitutes the church of St Quirin, a beautiful example of the Romanesque sacral architecture. The first information about it dates back,\n    from 1335 when the people of Krk gave the rent from the island Plavnik “for the repair of the church of St Quirin in Krk”. It is assumed that,\n    it was built in the 12th century. The church is particular for its two floors and its geographic orientation as its apse is completely,\n    untypically directed towards the south, probably owing to the constricted space on which it was built. The upper church is dedicated,\n    to St Quirin, the patron saint of the city of Krk, and the lower church of St Margaret was dedicated to the martyr from Antiochia.,\n    These Romanesque churches were built from white local stone. The appearance of the church is complemented by the three-apse ending with,\n    prominent ornament of blind Romanesque arcades at the top and the border made of polished red local stone (mandorlat) in the middle.,\n    It is assumed that the upper church (St Quirin) was actually the matroneum of the cathedral from where the women used to participate in,\n    the mass held in the cathedral. There is a possibility that St Quirin had the function of a palatine chapel of the Krk bishop or a western,\n    edifice (gallery, westwerk) from where the Krk princes followed the mass.,\n    The bell tower of the Krk cathedral is situated at the northern façade of St Quirin. The place of its construction was determined by the Venetian,\n    provveditore Vinciguerra in 1489, while the construction was finished in 1515. The bell tower was hit by lightning in 1714, when the main keystone,\n    pyramid cracked and crashed.,\n    In the 1760s, a thorough restoration was undertaken according to the sketches by the Venetian architect Pietro Checchi. A wooden angel coated in copper,\n    plates, made in Venice, was placed on the bell tower. Since 1973, there is a plastic angel at the top of the bell tower made according to the mould of the decrepit old angel.",

Today, only the single-nave longitudinal structure remained preserved with the sanctum on the south-east. Although the church has been subjected to many changes since the 15th century, all the earlier periods can easily be recognized on it. During the last restoration of the structure, the Romanesque stage of the church was revealed and presented, visible in the lines of regularly cut slate stone typical for Romanesque construction. The rearranged underpinning wall below the church contains public measures. It is assumed that the measures, intended for wine and grain, were made at the end of the 15th century. Today the church is used as an exhibition area in which you can see a series of important displays collected in the Dobrinj area. One of the items from this collection is the well-known Maskeron, taken from the house located to the north of the church. It is a very impressive sculpture, a man’s head, assumed to be the work of the local folk author from 1738. Mysterious and secretive, the work has become one of the Dobrinj brands.\n",

This is witnessed by an inscription from the 1st,\n    century b. C. mentioning the restoration of city walls, which indicates that the walls had already existed. Archaeological research of,\n    the western part of the wall in the 1960s found drywalled megalithic blocks dating from the 3rd century b. C. Such construction preceded,\n    the Roman style of construction known as opus quadratum. Archaeological research at the square Vela Placa and the house Perossi,\n    (café Volsonis) discovered a later antique wall with many in-built spolia (stellae, Liburnian cippi, parts of architrave…). The antique,\n    walls already had towers, while the Medieval and the Renaissance ones still visible today, constitute an important part of the city’s,\n    appearance. Besides the Castle and its towers, the polygonal towers from the 15th century on the coast and the main city gates, i.e. the,\n    former tower of the Town Hall on the main city square, the city had at least seven or eight smaller towers. The walls clearly visible today,\n    emerged mostly in the 14th and the 15th century, at the time of the emergence and development of fire arms. This is also confirmed by the,\n    stylistically defined embrasures and the crenelations (merlature).,\n    The old Frankopan castle is situated on the Square Kamplin, opposite to the Krk cathedral. The castle was the central and final point of the,\n    city’s defence. It was constructed in several stages, from the 12th until the 18th century. The oldest architectural element of the castle,\n    is the rectangular Frankopan tower, so called court house. We know that it was finished in 1191 owing to the Latin inscription in the lunette,\n    above the door. Its manner of construction distinguishes it from other architectural components of the castle, while the masonry of the large,\n    dressed stone blocks remind of the nearby Romanesque church of St Quirin. This difference in the way of construction is the basis of the theory,\n    about its possible independent existence in the time before the Castle existed in Krk and its function as the cathedral bell tower.,\n    The south-western tower of the Castle, the so called Austrian, is connected by wall to the remains of the tower above the Pizanska Gates.,\n    Considering the technique of construction and individual stylistic elements, it was probably built in the 14th century.,\n    The round tower of the Castle, called the Venetian tower, is directed towards the Square Kamplin. There is a stone plaque built into its walls,\n    with the inscription Aurea Venetorum Libertati and the symbol of St Marco. The ground floor has visible conical cannon openings. The original,\n    entrance to the tower, built with regular dressed stones with an iron grate that came down through the slot, is today walled in.

The church emerged in the High Middle Ages,,\n    during the Romanesque period, as a single-nave structure with a prominent semicircular apse and a bell tower on the façade.,\n    The walls around the church are the remains of a Benedictine monastery which contained this sacral structure. Archaeological research,\n    established that the monastery and the church emerged on an earlier antique farm building. The finding which made the church of,\n    St Lucia widely famous is located within the building.,\n    On the tablet of the altar wall there is the inscription known as the Baška tablet. This stone tablet is one of the oldest monuments of,\n    Croatian history. It contains thirteen lines in old Croatian language, mentioning the word “Croatian” and the name of the king Zvonimir.,\n    It dates back to 1100. The script, with which it was written, called the Glagolitic script, is completely different from the Latin script.,\n    Besides the Latin script, the Glagolitic script was used until the 19th century. The original tablet was moved to Zagreb in 1934 and is,\n    located in the hall of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Today the Glagolitic script has become a trademark of Baška, which is,\n    witnessed by large sculptures shaped like Glagolitic letters placed along the road leading to Baška.",

The church of the Annunciation of the,\n    Blessed Virgin Mary was completed in 1523 at the site of an older Romanesque church. It is richly adorned with two artistic breath-taking,\n    works of art. The triumphal arch of the church is decorated by 9.7-meter artistic composition by the Venetian master Francesco,\n    Ughetto showing the Last Judgement (Heaven, Purgatory and Hell) with a total of 123 figures. The other work that should be mentioned is the altar,\n    polyptych from 1535 by Girolamo da Santacroce, a Venetian master who left a large part of his artistic opus on the eastern Adriatic coast.,\n    Within the complex there is the museum display, a rich ethnographic, archaeological and sacral collection, as well as a library.

A real example of a city planned that way is the village Dobrinj,,\n    situated in the central part of the island. Although the defensive walls cannot be seen at first sight, that does not mean they are not there,,\n    but they are skilfully hidden within the thick walls of the outer rim of the city.,\n    After visiting Dobrinj, you should head towards Krk, a city whose long history is written in its walls and the Castle. The Krk Castle is famous,\n    under the name Frankopanski, so your next stop could be a secluded castle also owned by this family called Gradec, situated in the woods near Vrbnik.,\n    An excursion towards Gradec will reveal the charming forested landscapes of the island, so it is time to go towards Baška, which is adorned by even,\n    more theatrical rocky landscapes. The history of this settlement is related to the migration of the entire population from the hills into the lowland,\n    area near the sea, depending on the historical period of peace or war. Therefore, this excursion should be ended at the church of St Ivan and the castle,\n    above Baška, where the population used to move in case of an attack from the sea.
